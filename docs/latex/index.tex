\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item level-\/1\-:\-Write a function that accepts a sequence of moves and reports whether the sequence contains only valid knight moves. \-It should also optionally print the state of the knight board to the terminal as shown above after each move. \-The current position should be marked with a '\-K'.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Level 2\-: \-Compute a valid sequence of moves from a given start point to a given end point.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Level 3\-: \-Compute a valid sequence of moves from a given start point to a given end point in the fewest number of moves.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Level 4\-: \-Now repeat the \-Level 3 task for this 32x32 board. \-Also, modify your validator from \-Level 1 to check your solutions. \-This board has the following additional rules\-: 1) \-W\mbox{[}ater\mbox{]} squares count as two moves when a piece lands there 2) \-R\mbox{[}ock\mbox{]} squares cannot be used 3) \-B\mbox{[}arrier\mbox{]} squares cannot be used \-A\-N\-D cannot lie in the path 4) \-T\mbox{[}eleport\mbox{]} squares instantly move you from one \-T to the other in the same move 5) \-L\mbox{[}ava\mbox{]} squares count as five moves when a piece lands there
